This is just an EDH passion project schlepped together by a guy with a bit of professional knowledge, a very specific personal obsession, and the demeanor of Mister Rodgers raised on Run the Jewels. This will always be free and available and the best I can make it.",

MTG DNA intends to unify and standardize that process to ensure the EDH player has the best available option at any point in the lifecycle of your favorite legend in the zone from cradle to grave.",

Claude Code has enabled me to realize projects that before were just concepts. I believe in ethical LLM usage, with a human in the loop always. If you wish to confirm or correct my understanding, please feel free to reach out. I would appreciate the discussion.",
